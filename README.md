# Udacity Project 1: Investigate Dataset 
This is my first project in Udacity data anlysis prgram.

# Description
The goal of this project is to analyse one of the 5 or 6 datasets provided in the udacity classroom using  
the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. The data is meant to be explored, then come
up with at least three questions and answer them using the libraries. The specific dataset I use in this project is "No-show appointments". 
It is about whether or not patients show up for appointment.
I ask 9 questions, but the major ones are those that have relationship with showing up or not for the hospital appointment.
I analyze the data and answered all the 9 questions.
